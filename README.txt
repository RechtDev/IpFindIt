**Background**
The IpFindIt Console Application is an open source tool that allows users to quickly resolve IP-Addresses, do WhoIs searches and comes fully supported with a GUI for a more user-friendly approach. After each search
is done the results are saved to a file located on the user’s desktop. Since this project is open source anyone that is willing to help or have any other ideas for modules can help, either by submitting your idea or forking this project and making your add-ons and upon approval I will add it to the main project.

**Build Details**
IpFindIt was written in C# running on .Net Framework 4.71. The API’s used are located here: http://ip-api.com/json/. The WhoIs API will be implemented as soon as I can get a response from the creators of the API more details down below. Since the data sent back from the API is in a JSON format I used JSON.Net as the sterilizer and deserializer. Since I used a third-party library YOU will need to make sure to have the library’s files on your machine to use IpFindIt.  

**Extra Details**
Please be warned that this is a rough attempt and my first attempt at using GitHub and exposing my code to the masses. What might look nice in my eyes will not look nice in yours (As far as how I write my code). With there will be cases where my code will look confusing and you may have your own opinions on how something could have been done. Like I said earlier any changes and help is appreciated do not be afraid to call me out on errors and show me a better way or different way of achieving the same goal. This will be a community effort and IpFindIt will only be as good as we make it.

The reason why WhoIs Functionality Isn’t implemented is because the API was made to work with Python and can be used with C#, but I need help with doing that, so I contacted support. Again, this is a barebones program and I wouldn’t even consider this being close to being done.

This is a project I wanted to do for a long time not only is this helping me learn C# but also its making my dream of becoming a Software Engineer a little easier to grab. So please work with me and let’s make something happen.
